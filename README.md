This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

You have found an album you like and you want more.  Where do you look?

- **"more like this"** shows other albums that people who enjoyed this album have disproportionately liked
- **curated lists** show samples from genres containing thousands of albums
- you can **search** the album title or headliner and browse the hitlist
- by liking the album your **personal recommendations** may change slightly

You browse lists by clicking "next" over and over. It's a passive consumer experience.  The system keeps presenting you with albums you might like and your response is to say either yes or no.

This app presents a new method.

- by exploring your album's **neighborhood**

The *neighborhood* of an album is defined in a specific and objective way.   For each artist who played on your album, the neighborhood contains the last album they recorded before and the first album they recorded after recording your album.  

The interface lets you navigate the space of albums defined by the **colaboration graph**.  You make active choices, moving from node to node in the space, going in different directions.

## Collaboration Graphs

The usual definition has 

- nodes: musicians
- edges: two musicians are connected if they appear on the same album

These graphs are used to calculate degrees of separation between musicians.  Examples in other domains are the
Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon (actors appearing in movies) and Erd≈ës Numbers (mathematicians collaborating on academic papers).  The movies or papers function only to establish connections between people.


The approach here switches focus from people to the things they do together, in this case albums.  We are finding nearby albums rather than similar musicians.

- nodes: musicians and albums
- edges: musicians are connected to the albums they recorded for

Musicians are not connected to each other.  The use case requires minimal graph analysis that can be done on the fly in postgres using window functions.

Each edge has an important attribute:  the date of the recording.  Nearby albums will have overlapping personnel and be close in the time sequence of recordings done during the musician's career.  

Often an album has contributions from different dates, so the selection of nearby albums uses each musician's specific recording dates to find their last album before and first album after.  That is why you will sometimes see an album in the left column that was recorded later in time than an album in the right column.



## Artist Releases

[![artist releases](public/headliners-and-sidemen-artist-releases.png)](https://headliners-and-sidemen.vercel.app/artist_releases/4291)

Since we have the collaboration graph, we can show the complete history of a musicians appearances, on their own albums and those of other people.  The results are displayed in columns by year, capped at 500.  That's a lot, but on a large screen it is pretty cool.


## Data

The data is from [musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database).  

Here is the data extraction query.  The query has to be handled in batches.

```
select rg.id as release_group,
  rg.name as title,
  rga.name as headliner, 
  rga.id as headliner_id,
  a.name as artist,
  a.id as artist_id,
  lat.name as instrument, 
  min(make_date(l.begin_date_year, 
       coalesce(l.begin_date_month,1), 
       coalesce(l.begin_date_day,1))) as begin_date, 
  max(make_date(l.end_date_year, 
       coalesce(l.end_date_month,1), 
       coalesce(l.end_date_day,1))) as end_date
from release_group as rg
join release as r on r.release_group = rg.id
join artist as rga on rga.id = rg.artist_credit
join medium as m on m.release = r.id
join track as t on t.medium = m.id
join l_artist_recording as ar on ar.entity1 = t.recording
join artist a on a.id = ar.entity0
join link as l on l.id = ar.link
join link_attribute as la on la.link = l.id
join link_attribute_type as lat on lat.id = la.attribute_type
where rg.id between 1049000 and 1050000
and l.begin_date_year is not null
group by 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
;
```

Sample results:
```
10226	Blue Rondo	The Dave Brubeck Quartet	5444	Randy Jones	477140	drums (drum set)	1986-11-01	\N
10229	Red Holloway & Company	Red Holloway	5483	Cedar Walton	51394	piano	1987-01-01	\N
10229	Red Holloway & Company	Red Holloway	5483	Jimmie Smith	615236	drums (drum set)	1987-01-01	\N
10229	Red Holloway & Company	Red Holloway	5483	Red Holloway	5483	saxophone	1987-01-01	\N
10229	Red Holloway & Company	Red Holloway	5483	Richard Reid	1209898	bass	1987-01-01	\N
10231	Marian McPartland Plays the Music of Billy Strayhorn	Marian McPartland	5285	Jerry Dodgion	359201	alto saxophone	1987-03-01	\N
```

There are 67,615 musicians (artists) connected to 92,044 albums (release groups) through 1,018,092 recordings, extracted from a total of 2,351,000 albums.

Table schema for run-time queries:

## Implementation

The postgres database is hosted on an e2-micro (2 vCPUs, 1 GB memory) running on Google Compute Engines.

The app is built with nextjs and is hosted on both heroku and vercel.
- [heroku](https://headliners-and-sidemen.herokuapp.com/)
- [vercel](https://headliners-and-sidemen.vercel.app/)

## Postgres

This uses postgres user-defined functions in lieu of an ORM.  That makes it easy to use postgres window functions to get the first album before and next album after.  The javascript API transparently passes SQL query results back to the front end.  See /sql/setup/functions.sql for the function and type definitions.

```
exports.releaseGroup = function (release_group_id) {
	return performSQLQuery(`select * from release_group(${release_group_id});`);
};

exports.artistReleases = function (artist_id) {
	return performSQLQuery(`select * from artist_releases(${artist_id});`);
};

exports.lastBefore = function (release_group_id) {
	return performSQLQuery(`select * from last_before(${release_group_id});`);
};

exports.firstAfter = function (release_group_id) {
	return performSQLQuery(`select * from first_after(${release_group_id});`);
};

exports.search = function (query) {
	return performSQLQuery(`select * from search('${query}');`);
};
```
